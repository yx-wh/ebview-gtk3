/* File -> Search Disk for Dictionaries...
 *
 * One step: pick a folder, and the whole tree below it is scanned for
 * EPWING/EB books.  The original program (2002) asked the user to paste a
 * path and choose a small numeric depth because disks were slow; on a modern
 * SSD a full recursive scan is both fast and what people actually want.
 * The settings-page entry still offers an explicit Depth, using the same
 * depth semantics (0 = unlimited).  Both share scan_dictionaries(). */
